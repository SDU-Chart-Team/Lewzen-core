    "comment": "An Internationalized Resource Identifier.\n\nOn the Internet, resources are identified using IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers). For example, an SVG file called someDrawing.svg located at http://example.com might have the following IRI:\n```\nhttp://example.com/someDrawing.svg\n```\nAn IRI can also address a particular element within an XML document by including an IRI fragment identifier as part of the IRI. An IRI which includes an IRI fragment identifier consists of an optional base IRI, followed by a \"#\" character, followed by the IRI fragment identifier. For example, the following IRI can be used to specify the element whose ID is \"Lamppost\" within file someDrawing.svg:\n```\nhttp://example.com/someDrawing.svg#Lamppost\n```\nIRIs are used in the xlink:href attribute. Some attributes allow both IRIs and text strings as content. To disambiguate a text string from a relative IRI, the functional notation <FuncIRI> is used. This is an IRI delimited with a functional notation. Note: For historical reasons, the delimiters are \"url(\" and \")\", for compatibility with the CSS specifications. The FuncIRI form is used in presentation attributes.\nSVG makes extensive use of IRI references, both absolute and relative, to other objects. For example, to fill a rectangle with a linear gradient, you first define a <linearGradient> element and give it an ID, as in:\n```\n<linearGradient xml:id=\"MyGradient\">...</linearGradient>\n```\nYou then reference the linear gradient as the value of the fill attribute for the rectangle, as in the following example:\n```\n<rect fill=\"url(#MyGradient)\"/>\n```\nSVG supports two types of IRI references:\nlocal IRI references, where the IRI reference does not contain an <absoluteIRI> or <relativeIRI> and thus only contains a fragment identifier (i.e., #<elementID> or #xpointer(id<elementID>)).\nnon-local IRI references, where the IRI reference does contain an <absoluteIRI> or <relativeIRI>. For the full specification of IRI references in SVG, see SVG 1.1 (2nd Edition): IRI references.",
