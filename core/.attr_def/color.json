    "comment": "A <transform-list> is used to specify a list of coordinate system transformations. A detailed description of the possible values for a <transform-list> is given in the transform attribute definition.\nWithin the SVG DOM, a <transform-list> value is represented using an SVGTransformList or SVGAnimatedTransformList object.The basic type <color> is a CSS2 compatible specification for a color in the sRGB color space. <color> applies to SVG\\'s use of the color attribute and is a component of the definitions of attributes fill, stroke, stop-color, flood-color, and lighting-color, which also offer optional ICC-based color specifications.\nSVG supports all of the syntax alternatives for <color> defined in CSS2 syntax and basic data types, and (depend on the implementation) in the future CSS Color Module Level 3.\nA <color> is either a keyword or a numerical RGB specification.\nIn addition to these color keywords, users may specify keywords that correspond to the colors used by objects in the user\\'s environment. The normative definition of these keywords is found in User preferences for colors (CSS2, section 18.2).\nThe format of an RGB value in hexadecimal notation is a \"#\" immediately followed by either three or six hexadecimal characters. The three-digit RGB notation (#rgb) is converted into six-digit form (#rrggbb) by replicating digits, not by adding zeros. For example, #fb0 expands to #ffbb00. This ensures that white (#ffffff) can be specified with the short notation (#fff) and removes any dependencies on the color depth of the display. The format of an RGB value in the functional notation is an RGB start-function, followed by a comma-separated list of three numerical values (either three integer values or three percentage values) followed by \")\". An RGB start-function is the case-insensitive string \"rgb(\", for example \"RGB(\" or \"rGb(\". For compatibility, the all-lowercase form \"rgb(\" is preferred. The integer value 255 corresponds to 100%, and to F or FF in the hexadecimal notation: rgb(255,255,255) = rgb(100%,100%,100%) = #FFF. White space characters are allowed around the numerical values. All RGB colors are specified in the sRGB color space. Using sRGB provides an unambiguous and objectively measurable definition of the color, which can be related to international standards.\n```\ncolor    ::= \"#\" hexdigit hexdigit hexdigit (hexdigit hexdigit hexdigit)?\n              | \"rgb(\"integer, integer, integer\")\"\n              | \"rgb(\"integer \"%\", integer \"%\", integer \"%)\"\n              | color-keyword\nhexdigit ::= [0-9A-Fa-f]\n```\nwhere color-keyword matches (case insensitively) one of the color keywords listed in CSS Color Module Level 3, or one of the system color keywords listed in User preferences for colors (CSS2, section 18.2).\nThe corresponding SVG DOM interface definitions for <color> are defined the one defined by CSS. SVG\\'s extension to color, including the ability to specify ICC-based colors, are represented using DOM interface SVGColor.",
